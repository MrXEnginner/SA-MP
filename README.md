# San Andreas Multiplayer

This is an ongoing work-in-progress decompilation of the latest version of San Andreas Multiplayer (SA-MP), a free Massively Multiplayer Online game mod for the PC version of Rockstar Games Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.

The project aims to be a matching decompilation. Meaning, producing a source code base that, when it's recompiled with the same compiler the original developers used, outputs the exact same binary as the original one.

Decompiling the containing binaries from the following version packages:

| Name | MD5 |
| --- | --- |
| sa-mp-0.3.7-R5-1-install.exe | `f7874cc8637e5ddb98b07ed40a24de58`
| samp037_svr_R3_win32.zip | `1f35cc9fbfd4db61e0f8fe1efce362ec`
| samp037svr_R3.tar.gz | `901286f80f8a5ac9bd784f6091337f84`
